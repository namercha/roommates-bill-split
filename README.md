## Roommates Bill Split program
This program asks the user to enter the bill amount (dollar value), for example a utility bill. 
The program then asks for the bill period, name and how many days was the user in the house (so bill is split proportionally). 
Program calculates how much user 1 has to pay and how much user 2 has to pay weighted by how long each user was in the house. 
The program also generates a pdf report, or bill with the image of a house and the amount each roommate has to pay.
